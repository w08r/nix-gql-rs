# Nix (Flakes)

## Introduction

This first set of docs illustrates some basic usage of nix, using
flakes, which provide an (experimental/non-stable .. but pretty
stable) alternative workflow and tooling.

- [Hello](./hello) dips in to initial usage using a docker container
  as a playground.
- [Hello (Flake)!](./hello-flake) looks at a simple development
  environment based on historic unix standards.
- [ Nix and Flake-utils](./nix-flake-utils) Introduces some of the nix
  language along with starting to delve into the flake utils library.
- [Direnv integration](./direnv) walks you through the development
  experience brought to you by nix flakes and direnv.
- [Rust, Grapql, Nix, Docker](./rs-gql) explores setting up a
  development and build environment for a web service.
- [Spark, Mill and Overrides](./spark) explores overriding some
  default attributes of an existing package to ensure uniformity.
## Digging Deeper
